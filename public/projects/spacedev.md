SpaceDev is a software factory company where I work as a fullstack developer. During this year and a half, I learned a lot, and worked on 4 exiting projects using React, React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and much more.

SpaceDev is also the company that helped me to move from Argentina to Uruguay, the country I'm living currently. Full of honest and energetic people from whom I learn a lot.

Some of the tasks I perform here are:

- Frontend development using React, React Native, Redux, and more.
- Backend development with Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, Socket.io, MongoDB, and more.
- Architecture redesign including backend, frontend, and databases
- Direct client communication to define the requirements and estimate requested features.
- Providing help to my coworkers anytime they have doubts with React, CSS, javascript dates, or anything related to frontend development.
