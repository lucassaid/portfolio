        Passion, love to bring new ideas to the projects I work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to be a full stack developer, but I saw the light. I am a <b>frontend developer</b> now. I can focus on improving my skills and keep specializing in what I&apos;m good at: Draft quality, composable components, and build great user interfaces. .
      </p>
      <p>
        I still know backend development with Node, MongoDB, Redis, SQL, Firebase, and so on... But I think my value is here.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this page you&apos;ll see some of the things I&apos;ve worked on.
