      <p>
        At the age of 13 I started to learn HTML and CSS by changing the source code of my blog (Blogspot at the time). I found my vocation through trial and error, adding buttons, changing some colors, copy-pasting code I didn&apos;t understand, and most importantly, breaking and fixing code.

        I have been working as a full stack developer for seven years now, continuously learning and growing both as a developer and as a professional. I&apos;m always trying to expand my knowledge in different areas, and deepen my understanding of programming&apos;s fundamental concepts.
