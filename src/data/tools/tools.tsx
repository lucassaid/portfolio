        <p>
          I migrated from Lit Element to React, already knowing basic concepts like lifecycle and props.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these two and half years I worked on several apps and projects made with React:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-4">
          <li>
            10 React apps started from scratch and currently in production
          </li>
          <li>
            3 React Apps in production maintained as a team member at SpaceDev, along with some other projects I pitch in to help
          </li>
          <li>
            5 personal or client projects that never got to production
          </li>
          <li>
            Starting some open source libraries (listed below)

        I wrote pure CSS for around 5 years, and a little of SCSS too. I couldn&apos;t go back to the traditional way, since Tailwind makes the styling a thousand times faster and fun.

      <p>
        I tend to set the state of the components in their closest common ancestor (<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">as recommended</a>).
        But yes, we often need some state to be global, and Recoil is a great choice to get it. I have used Recoil in my last projects and it is really natural and easy to use.

        I started learning React with Next.js and made around 10 projects with it, 7 of them currently in production.
        Lately I&apos;m using CRA mostly because I really like React Router and SWR.

        It&apos;s surprising to see how the quality of the code improves using this library, I really think we don&apos;t need Redux anymore üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
        Actually, the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/swr/issues/315#issuecomment-606172104">Vercel team has been using SWR instead of Redux for more than two years now</a>.

        Using Typescript for around one year now, for my last projects. I couldn&apos;t go back to write plain javascript after this, Typescript saves a lot of time, prevents errors,
        and it lets you write cleaner code with more confidence.
