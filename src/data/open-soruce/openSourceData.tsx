        <p>
          Small React hook that handles the events of an input to understand whether you are trying to mention someone.
          You can write the name of a user to filter the list, and use the arrow keys to change the selection.
        </p>
        <p>
          All markup and styles up to you (c&apos;mon it takes you 5 minutes using tailwind!)

          Currently being used on production in a chat app.

        <p>Finally a cool speedometer for React üòé. This is a largely customizable set of components to create your own speedometer.</p>
        <p>
          Performant, made out of SVG, supports negative numbers, and overall cool. You can use render props to render your own needle, marks, and more (because I&apos;m an addict to render props I can&apos;t help it).

          I have plans for unifying these since the code (except some JSX) is actually the same üßê.
