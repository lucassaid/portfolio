  aboutMe: "At the age of 13 I started to learn HTML and CSS by changing the source code of my blog (Blogspot at the time). Through trial and error, copy-pasting code and breaking things, I was adding buttons and changing colors, without knowing that thanks to that I found my vocation. I work mainly as a frontend. After 12 years of my first contact with CSS, I can say we're friends. I'm currently focused on learn new tools and deepen the base concepts of programming.",
