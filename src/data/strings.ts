  aboutMe: `At the age of 13 I started to learn HTML and CSS by changing the source code of my blog (Blogspot at the time). I found my vocation through trial and error, adding buttons, changing some colors, copy-pasting code I didn't understand, and most importantly, breaking and fixing code. I worked formally as a fullstack developer for 6 years, and now I decided to focus on frontend development. I'm currently focused on learn new tools and deepen the base concepts of programming.`,
